# Hypixel-item-concept-generator
want to make some concepts for hypixel skyblock? maybe try and get a creative mind? well you can generate some items in vanilla minecraft (1.18) to show them off.

## Usage
you will need to change the generate_command statment to what you want. this should appear at the bottom of hypixel-item-gen.py
